Writing Scripts
===============

In your application, you can put in automation by writing scripts. These scripts can be use for
checking value of inputs, doing calculations, fetching values from other records etc.

Scripts are executed on events. These events can be triggered on the server-side or client-side.

For more advanced function relating to scripts, please see the API and Cookbook

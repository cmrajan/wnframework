What is an Application?
=======================

Let us define a typical web application as being a set of:

   #. Users - who use the application
   #. Roles - roles assigned to users for various functions
   #. Pages - where users navigate and see relevant information
   #. Forms - where users enter new data
   #. Reports - where users get a tabulated view of their data
   #. Permission Rules - that define what each role is allowed to do or not do
   #. Logic - Automatic actions that are performed at various events
   #. Validations - Checks that ensure the data entered by the users is valid
   #. Print Formats - Printable documents based on the data users have entered
   #. UI Widgets - Menus, Lists, Dialogs that are used for navigating, entering or displaying information
   #. Module - So that you can group Roles, Forms, Pages, Reports for more complex applications

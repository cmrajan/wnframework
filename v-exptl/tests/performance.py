# This file implements several useful example snippets that can be used to
# return a desired performance number to the main JavaStats monitor. Basically,
# you need to implement two methods given in the Performance base class: 
# acquire_command and get_performance_data. The former will adjust the java
# run command and set it up to gather the desired data. The latter will examine
# the resulting trace file and fetch the desired data.

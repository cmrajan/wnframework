Creating Users (Profile)
========================

A Profile (=user) has a unique identity in the system and can be tagged as an "onwer" to a data record. 
Profiles can also be assigned Roles that restrict what they can do. You can also define custom logic 
for a Profile

To create a new Profile:

   #. Create a new Profile via "New" on the top toolbar
   #. Enter the mandatory "First Name" and "Email" values
   #. "Save" the profile via the "Save" button
   #. The user will be sent an email with her random-genereated password. You can also set a custom password
      by clicking on the "Password" tab and setting the password.
   #. *To assign a role, click on the "Roles" tab and add a "Role" in the table.*
      
Once a Profile is created, the user can login with the login id (email) and password.
      
.. note::
   
   Profiles are given an id that is the same as their email id. Why did we do this?
   
      * Email Ids are good unique identifiers. Your users may have the same first and last names,
        but they would have separate Email Ids
      * People usually remember their email ids
      * Email Ids are these days the de-facto way to define login-ids

Creating Entities
=================

To create any entity, you must have the relevant permission. Once you have the relevant permission, you can
create new entities from the top toolbar.

Look out for the "New" button on the top left of the page. Via the "New" dialog box, you can create any 
entity you have rights to create.

.. note::

   * Entities in wnframework are known by their "name". Name has the same concept as id - its a unique key 
     for that entity (same as a Primary Key).
   * Every entity also has an "owner" - By default this is the user who creates that entity.
